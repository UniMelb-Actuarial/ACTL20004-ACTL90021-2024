Some of the required knowledge is reviewed in the Module 1 tutorial set. I strongly recommend you review those materials before the semester starts.\nUse of the software R #  R is required prior knowledge for this course, and part of the prerequisite course MAST20005 (Statistics).\nThis is because R is a required software for the actuarial professional exams CS1 and CS2 (see https://www.actuaries.org.uk/studying/curriculum/actuarial-statistics and also https://www.actuaries.org.uk/studying/curriculum/frequently-asked-questions-curriculum ). It is used very widely by actuaries in industry (see, for instance, https://www.actuaries.digital/2019/09/26/my-top-10-r-packages-for-data-analytics/ ). Some companies also use R to produce presentations and documentation for generally.\nIn order to help you with R I have put together a website that summarises all the things I think you should know before starting your first grad role: https://communicate-data-with-r.netlify.app At the very least, you need to know what is under \u0026ldquo;Base R\u0026rdquo;. Learning the \u0026ldquo;tidyverse\u0026rdquo; will be most useful, as well as \u0026ldquo;ggplot2\u0026rdquo; for better visualisations. \u0026ldquo;htmlwidgets\u0026rdquo; is more advanced, and not required for the course. You may want to create your assignment with \u0026ldquo;R Markdown\u0026rdquo; (under \u0026ldquo;Communicate Data\u0026rdquo;), although this is not required either.\nThe main reference for Base R is the book http://biostatisticien.eu/springeR/index-en.html which is also available in other languages (including mandarin). The English version can be downloaded for free from the Unimelb library: https://go.openathens.net/redirector/unimelb.edu.au?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1007%2F978-1-4614-9020-3\nI strongly recommend you review the R materials mentioned above before the semester starts.\nSee also the Actuaries Institute Analytics Cookbook: https://www.actuaries.digital/2021/11/30/the-actuaries-analytics-cookbook-recipes-for-data-success/\nhttps://actuariesinstitute.github.io/cookbook/docs/index.html\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/0-study-plan/week-1/","title":"Week 1 Study Plan","section":"Weekly Study Plan","content":"Week 1 Overview #  This week, we will cover the following topics:\n Introduction to the course (Module 1): what are the broader questions we will answer in this subject, and how are they connected?

This counts towards the ‚ÄúFoundation Program‚Äù of the Australian Actuaries Institute professional curriculum and syllabus.\nIn particular, ACTL30007 is meant to cover Items 1 and 2 of the CS2 syllabus. This is detailed in the following table, with mapping towards the course modules (and major reference in parentheses; see ‚ÄúSubject Resources‚Äù below), as well as subject intended learning outcomes (SLO).\nItem 1 ‚Äì Random variables and distributions for risk modelling #     CS2 Subject module (main reference) SILO          1.1 Loss distributions, with and without risk sharing.

Details about readings are available below under \u0026ldquo;Subject Resources\u0026rdquo;. They can be downloaded from the Canvas Readings Online.  Note this subject is one-quarter of a standard load. That means, including attendance at classes, you should be putting the equivalent of one quarter of a week‚Äôs work into this subject, i.e. 9 to 10 hours.\nLecture Slides and Materials #  All materials are available on this website.\nThe most salient exception are lecture recordings, with annotated slides, which are cohort specific, and which will be available with the associated recording on Echo360.\nMaterials tagged with a `\\(\\maltese\\)` sign are out-of-scope. They are included for your interest, but they won't be assessed. Exercises are also provided for students who are interested in learning those materials. They are however, out-of-scope for this subject in 2023. Recorded Lectures #  Audio and video recordings of lectures delivered in this subject will be made available for review. These recordings allow you to revise lectures during the semester, or to review them in preparation for the end of semester exam.\nYou can access recorded lectures by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Lecture Capture\u0026rdquo; menu item on the LMS page for this subject. Recordings will be embedded in this website though under the Weekly Study Plan section, and will be accessible from here, provided you are logged into Canvas in the same browser.\nPlease note that for live classes, recordings are not a substitute for attendance; rather they are designed for revision. On rare occasions the recordings can fail to take place due to technical reasons. In such cases, a substitute recording will not be made available.\nTutorials #  Tutorial Times #  Tutorials start in week 1.

Any claim by a private tutoring service that they are in possession of, or can supply you with, forthcoming University exam or assignment questions or \u0026ldquo;insider\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;exclusive\u0026rdquo; information is also false and misleading. The University has no relationship whatsoever with any of these services and takes these claims very seriously as they threaten to damage the University‚Äôs reputation and undermine its independence.  It is also not appropriate for students to provide course materials (including University curricula, reading materials, exam and assignment questions and answers) to operators of these businesses for the purposes of allowing them to conduct commercial tutoring activities. Doing so may amount to misconduct and will be taken seriously. Those materials contain intellectual property owned or controlled by the University.\nWe encourage you to bring to the attention of Faculty staff any behaviour or activity that is not aligned with University expectations or policy as outlined above.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/0-study-plan/week-3/","title":"Week 3 Study Plan","section":"Weekly Study Plan","content":"Week 3 Overview #  This week, we will cover the following topics:\n End of Section 3.4, covering the most complicated case of left-truncation and right-censoring (with parameters changing potentially with each claim) Model selection (Module 3): how do we assess how good a model fits to data (‚Äúgoodness-of-fit‚Äù)?

Students must click ‚Äòsubmit‚Äô at the completion time if they did not start the exam at the scheduled commencement time to not incur any late penalty.\nFor example, a 60-minute exam scheduled at 3:00pm, but commenced at 3:15pm, will automatically submit at 4:15pm and the student will incur a late penalty. Students must click \u0026lsquo;submit\u0026rsquo; at 4:00pm to not incur a late penalty. Students who are prevented from submitting on time or at all due to technical difficulties will need to apply for technical consideration with supporting documentation.\nMid-semester exam #  Date #  The mid-semester exam will take place online on Monday 17 April 2023 between 2.30pm and 3.30pm. Please arrive by 2.15pm at the latest. The exam won\u0026rsquo;t start before 2.30pm, but it may start later, so please make sure you are available until 4pm.\nType #  The mid-semester exam will be a \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo;, closed book, pen on paper exam.\nYou will be allowed to bring one A4 sheet of notes, double sided. You can write as much as you want on that one sheet of paper (text and/or formulas), on both sides, but it cannot be more than one A4 sheet.\nYou will be allowed to bring a Casio FX-82 (with or without suffix) calculator.\nVenue #   207-221 Bouverie St, B103 - Theatre 1\nDuration #  60 minutes sharp, plus 5 minutes reading time.\nScope #  The mid-semester exam will assess contents from Modules 1 to 5 (lectures of weeks 1-5) and associated tutorial exercises, readings, R codes, and course contents. This focuses on the claims modelling component of the subject.\nExaminable materials include associated tutorial questions, revision questions, additional questions, technical and practice lectures with slides and associated mandatory readings.\nPractice #  The exam will be of the \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; type, in line if the IFoA CS2A exams; see below for details.\nAdditional details #  See General Advice for further details.\nIndividual assignment #  Assignment instructions #  The assignment will be a data analysis assignment which will need to be performed in R, and you will need to submit a 5 minute oral presentation, with slides.\nThe assignment will assess skills from Modules 1 to 4 (lectures of weeks 1-4) and associated tutorial exercises, readings, R codes, and course contents (this is to be confirmed). This focuses on the claims modelling component of the subject. Communication skills will also be assessed.\nAdditional details and instructions will be available later (around mid-semester exam time).\nAssignment submission #  Assignment submission is via the LMS Assignment Submission link for all written assignments. Please refer to the Turnitin section of the LMS website via for detailed submission instructions if needed.\nPlease note that you are required to keep a copy of your assignment after it has been submitted as you must be able to produce a copy of your assignment at the request of teaching staff at any time after the submission due date.\nPenalties for Late Submission #  In order to ensure equality for all students, assignments and examinations (where relevant) must be submitted by specified deadlines. Late assignments, where approval for late submission has not been given, will be penalised at the rate of 20% of the total mark per day, for up to 5 days, at which time a mark of zero will be given.\nStudents with a genuine and acceptable reason for not completing an assignment (or other assessment task), such as illness, can apply for special consideration. Special Consideration assists students who have been significantly affected by illness or other serious circumstances during the semester. The following website contains detailed information relating to who can apply for Special Consideration and the process for making an application: http://students.unimelb.edu.au/admin/special\nFinal exam #  Date #  The date of the final exam is published on the University of Melbourne Exams Timetable website.\nAt your scheduled date, the final exam will be available on the Canvas website under \u0026quot;Assignments\u0026quot;.\nDuration #  Important online examination information: This examination is the equivalent of a 2-hour assessment; however, students are provided with 3-hours to accommodate the time that will be required for typesetting of mathematical expressions, loading, processing and modelling of data with the statistical software R, and the uploading of documents / answers.\nCanvas Quiz will automatically submit the exam when the time limit (comprised of reading time \u0026amp; writing time) has been reached (for example, after 60 minutes for an exam with 30 minutes of writing time and 30 minutes of reading time). Students must click ‚Äòsubmit‚Äô at the completion time if they did not start the exam at the scheduled commencement time to not incur any late penalty.\nFor example, a 60-minute exam scheduled at 3:00pm, but commenced at 3:15pm, will automatically submit at 4:15pm and the student will incur a late penalty. Students must click \u0026lsquo;submit\u0026rsquo; at 4:00pm to not incur a late penalty. Students who are prevented from submitting on time or at all due to technical difficulties will need to apply for technical consideration with supporting documentation.\nScope #  The final exam will assess all contents of the course, with particular focus on the materials taught after week 5. This means there will be questions on both the claims modelling and time series components of the subject.\nExaminable materials include associated tutorial questions, revision questions, additional questions, technical and practice lectures with slides and associated mandatory readings, as well as the assignment task and the mid-semester exam.\nMarks and allocation to topics #  Will be available later.\nExam consultation #  Will be announced later.\nQuestions and issues during the exam #  All exams will be moderated. Please log your concern via the Canvas chat board in the first instance using the Big Blue Button.\nAlternatively, you can call the following numbers for assistance during the exam if you are experiencing technical difficulties. Inside Australia: 13MELB (13 6352) (select Option 1 for current students then select Option 1 again for exam enquiries). Outside Australia: +61 3 9035 5511 (select Option 1 for current students and then select Option 1 again for exam enquiries).\nAdditional details #  See Exam Format and General Advice for further details.\nSee also the University of Melbourne exam webpage for students.\nFormat of online exams #  The final exams will be a Canvas quiz. Questions will be randomised, such that there are millions of possible combinations of questions, even before answers are shuffled (and they will be when relevant).\nThese is an Open Book exam, which means that you will not be prevented from using notes or texts during the exam. However, interaction with other students is not permitted, and is a breach of the University‚Äôs Academic Integrity Policy. Any evidence of collusion will be investigated as potential academic misconduct. The Academic Integrity policy can be found at: https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/\nIt is recommended that you use Google Chrome to access your exam on Canvas. Firefox has also been shown to be reliable.\nExam conditions #  It is important for students to be in a private, quiet and well-lit room. Please let us emphasize that you should not discuss exam matters with others and that you should only submit work of your own.\nThe Academic Integrity policy can be found at: https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/\nTypes of quiz questions #  There will be three types of questions:\n Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) with exactly one correct answer. These are similar to those used in the mid-semester exam. Students get full mark for a correct answer, and 0 marks for an incorrect answer.   Example: What is the result of 2 times 4?  4 6 8 10   In this example there is only one correct answer ‚Äì 3.  Multiple Answers Questions (MAQ) In this case, there are multiple choices, but the number of correct answers can be different from 1 (it can be anything from 0 to the number of possible choices). Here is the explanation of Canvas about how marks are awarded: ‚ÄúTo calculate scores for Multiple Answers quiz questions, Canvas divides the total points possible by the amount of correct answers for that question. This amount is awarded for every correct answer selected and deducted for every incorrect answer selected. No points are awarded or deducted for correct or incorrect answers that are not selected. For example, an instructor may create a Multiple Answer quiz question with 9 points possible that includes three correct choices and two incorrect choices. If a student selects two correct answers and one incorrect answer, they would be awarded 3 total points for that question. This would be calculated by awarding 3 points (9 total points divided by 3 correct answers) for each correct answer and subtracting 3 points for the incorrect answer.‚Äù Furthermore, there is a minimum score of 0 (you can‚Äôt get a negative score).   Example: Which of the following are negative?  4 -6 -8 10   In this example there are two correct answers: 2. and 3.. If there are 4 marks allocated to this question, marks would be awarded as follows:   and 3.: 2+2=4 marks    only: 2 marks    and 4.: 2-2=0 marks     and 2. and 4.: -2+2-2=-2 but there is a minimum score of 0, so 0 marks.     With this type of question you must carefully assess every single answer independently of the others.  Essay Questions In this case, you must answer with text, and you get a text field to compose your answer. Note that formulas can be composed too. You may also upload a handwritten answer if you wish, although we recommend not to do this unless formulas are required extensively. These questions will be marked by someone as they cannot be automatically graded.  Precision of numerical answers #  Students often ask about the required significant figures / decimal places.\nIf it is not specified:\n In an open question we will look at the reasoning so you should not be too worried about it (within reason). Use, say, 5 significant figures/digits \\(*\\) Otherwise the precision needs to match that of the possible answers (if we have 5 significant figures ( \\(*\\) ) in the answers then work with 6, say).  \\(*\\) Please move away from talking about decimal places - this does not take the scale of your problem into account. The correct way to think about this is in terms of significant figures/digits. For more details, see e.g. Wikipedia or this video from Khan academy.  Exam preparation #  Assessments in this course will generally:\n test whether you can apply the methods in a realistic environment (in particular, with data and R); test whether you understand the theory behind those methods, and can explain the associated strengths and limitations.  To prepare for this exam we suggest you review the tutorial exercises and past exam questions. You should also make sure you read all prescribed readings and have understood the main arguments. Remember that this is an open book exam, so there is nothing to memorise. You must demonstrate understanding instead, and being able to \u0026ldquo;connect the dots\u0026rdquo;. If you have done the work and know where the things are, you should be able to easily find the details you need to answer the questions.\nMore specifically:\n Finalise your own summaries and formula sheets in preparation for the exam. I recommend you review carefully the Detailed Learning Outcomes pages:  For Actuarial Practice: are you able to do all these? (describe, list, explain, \u0026hellip;); if you are on top of those you should be well prepared for the final exam; For Actuarial Techniques: do you understand all those formulas? Do you have formulas to add? Is there anything to add to your own summaries?   Of course, review also all tutorial exercises. For each question:  What skill(s) is this exercise testing? Where are the required concepts in your summaries? in your formula sheets? What did you find challenging in this exercise, and how comfortable are you with this now?    Specific preparation for R questions #  Here is general advice about how to prepare for that component of the subject:\n After the lectures (or before), make sure you implement all codes on your own machine. These can be copy pasted from the website easily, and there is nothing that is missing. I am using those exact codes to produce the outputs; there is no hidden chunk. Try to understand what each line is doing. Execute the code line by line, change parameters, see what it changes. Understand why it works or not. For each function you don\u0026rsquo;t know read the help in R. For function foo, simply write ?foo in the console. Google up issues, ask on Ed if you are stuck.  You can\u0026rsquo;t wait until the exam to work out the codes. In the mid-semester exam, one could essentially copy paste the codes from the slides. In the final exam you may have to adjust slightly one way or the other, and for this you need to be on top of the lecture slide code.\nBeing able to implement those methods is really important, and what makes the assessment \u0026ldquo;authentic\u0026rdquo;. This is how you would actually use that knowledge in practice, not via proving theorems (although that can be fun, too, but it is not too well suited for an open book exam).\nGeneral Advice #  Past CS2 exams #  This subject is one of three subjects leading to exemption from the IFoA CS2 exam; see also the SILO page. This provides with a very extensive range of practice exams. Note:\n CS2A exams are closed book pen on paper exams CS2B exams are R based Past exams and solutions are downloadable here  A mapping of the relevant questions, into Modules of this subject, is available here.\nTips #  Remember there are different ways of answering a multiple choice/answer question (especially if it involves numbers):\n Work out the answer as if you were in a standard pen and paper invigilated exam, then see if the answer is in the list. Work out the answer with tools that would not otherwise be available, such as Excel spreadsheet, R, or even the internet. (but be careful not to collude or otherwise be guilty of academic misconduct ‚Äì check https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/ for further details) In some circumstances, it may be easier to simply ‚Äúplug back‚Äù the different answers to see which one works. Don‚Äôt forget these three options exist for multiple choice/answer open book exams! Hence make sure you have Excel and R available and working before the exam starts.  Furthermore, some more advice / exam technique / tips:\n Read attentively the exam questions at least twice before attempting the question. Work out what skills you are meant to demonstrate. Make sure you understand what is being asked in the question ‚Äì consider key words indicating what you have to do. When you have finished, re-read the question to make sure you have not missed anything. Key is to demonstrate understanding. Attempt all questions where possible. If you run out of time, explain how to you would approach the task (where possible). If this is right this should give you marks. Do questions you are most confident with first. Prioritise. Observe the number of marks allocated. Manage time accordingly. Reassess your available time regularly (say, half way through for a 1 hour exam, and perhaps 2 times for a 2 hour exam). For instance, if the exam is one hour and there are 100 marks, then you have 36 seconds per mark.  Pay close attention to the wording of the question - this is not chosen randomly. Pay particular attention to the verb (for instance: \u0026ldquo;State\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Show\u0026rdquo; do not mean the same thing. With \u0026ldquo;State\u0026rdquo; you just need to give the answer, with \u0026ldquo;Show\u0026rdquo; you need to actually prove the answer) and adverb if any (for instance: \u0026ldquo;briefly\u0026rdquo; is not the same as \u0026ldquo;in detail\u0026rdquo;). Examples are:\n ‚Äò\u0026hellip;Justify your answer‚Äô ‚ÄòFind‚Äô ‚ÄòExplain in words‚Äô ‚ÄòDerive‚Äô ‚ÄòShow that‚Äô ‚ÄòBriefly list‚Äô ‚ÄòPresent in detail\u0026hellip;‚Äô ‚ÄòBriefly explain‚Äô ‚ÄòBriefly describe‚Äô ‚ÄòState (without justification) 4 examples of \u0026hellip;‚Äô  "},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/0-study-plan/week-5/","title":"Week 5 Study Plan","section":"Weekly Study Plan","content":"Week 5 Overview #  Continuing on with the Claims Modelling component of the subject, which corresponds to the Section 1 of the CS2 syllabus; In particular, we will cover Module 5‚ÄìCopulas‚Äìand\n discuss what stochastic dependence means, how it arises in an insurance context, and discuss some examples; discuss how to extract the mathematical form of a stochastic dependence structure through copulas briefly discuss how to use copulas in practice  Here is the end of week 4 video, which introduces week 5:\n If you wish to watch the embedded videos from Lecture Capture, you need to have logged in and entered Lecture Capture via Canvas once for each session.

Events and Probability #  Vocabulary: events vs probability #  It is important to understand the difference between events and probability:\n Event: what could happen - an actual ‚Äúthing,‚Äù in real life, that could happen; Probability: our understanding of the ‚Äúlikelihood‚Äù (or frequency) of an event (something that could occur).  So when we are building a mathematical model for uncertain outcomes:\n The first step is to work out what are all the possible things that could occur (for instance, ‚Äúrain‚Äù or ‚Äúno rain‚Äù). The full set of those is denoted \\(\\Omega\\). The second step is to make assumptions about how likely those things can occur. Here ‚Äù \\(\\Pr\\) ‚Äù is an operator that maps an event into a probability. For instance, \\(\\Pr[\\text{rain}]=0.2\\) means that the likelihood corresponding to the event ‚Äúrain‚Äù is 20%.  In what follows we outline basic results and axioms around events and their probabilities. Often logic means that a result or definition on one side (e.g.¬†events) can be translated on the other side (e.g.¬†probabilities).\nFor instance, the complement to an event is exactly whatever could happen, that is not the event. Hence, the probability of the complement must be 1 minus the probability of the original event; see 2.1.2.4 below.\nEvents, operations of events, probability of an event #   \\(\\emptyset\\): empty set, that it, it is an impossible event: $$\\Pr(\\emptyset) = 0.$$ \\(\\Omega\\): the full set of possible outcomes, that is, it is a certain event: $$\\Pr(\\Omega) = 1.$$ \\(A\\): an event (within \\(\\Omega\\)), \\(0 \\leq \\Pr(A) \\leq 1\\). \\(A^C\\): the event that \\(A\\) does not occur (called a ‚Äúcomplement‚Äù): $$\\Pr(A^C) = 1 - \\Pr(A).$$ \\(A \\cap B\\): \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the event that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur. \\(A \\cup B\\): \\(A\\) or \\(B\\), the event that either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\), or both events occur. \\(A \\subseteq B\\): If \\(A\\) occurs, \\(B\\) must, and:  \\(\\Pr(A) \\leq \\Pr(B)\\); \\(A \\cap B = A\\).\nExample: \\(A\\) = {a 20-year old survives to age 70}, \\(B\\) = {the 20-year old survives to age 50}. Then \\(A \\subseteq B\\).    Mutually exclusive events #  If $$A \\cap B = \\emptyset,$$ then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive.

Random variables and their distribution #  Definition #  A random variable, denoted by capital letters \\(X, Y, Z\\), is a quantity whose value is subject to variations due to chance.\nDistribution Function #  Definition: $$F(x) = \\Pr(X \\leq x) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ x\\in \\mathbb{R}$$ \\(F(x)\\) is called the distribution function of \\(X\\), and it has the following properties:\n \\(F(-\\infty) = 0, F(\\infty) = 1\\). \\(F(x_1) \\leq F(x_2)\\), if \\(x_1 \\leq x_2\\). \\(F(x)\\) is right-continuous (aka ‚Äúc√†dl√†g‚Äù), i.e., \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow x_0^+} F(x) = F(x_0)\\). \\(F(b) - F(a) = \\Pr (a \u0026lt; X \\leq b)\\). \\(F(b-) - F(a) = \\Pr (a \u0026lt; X \u0026lt; b)\\). \\(F(b) - F(a-) = \\Pr (a \\leq X \\leq b)\\). \\(F(b) - F(b-) = \\Pr (X = b) \\ge 0\\)  In our subject, we generally assume that \\(X \\geq 0\\) so that \\(F(x) = 0\\) for \\(x\u0026lt;0\\).\nDifference betweeen continuous and discrete random variables #  As an introduction to differences between continuous and discrete random variables, review this video:\n Continuous random variables ( \\(X \\geq 0\\) ) #  \\(X\\) is said to be a continuous r.v. if \\(X\\) has a probability density function \\(f(x)\\), \\(x \\geq 0\\), with the following properties:\n \\(f(x) = F'(x)\\). \\(F(x) = \\int_{0}^x f(y) dy\\). \\(\\Pr(a \u0026lt; X \\leq b) = \\Pr(a \u0026lt; X \u0026lt; b) = \\Pr(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\Pr(a \\leq X \u0026lt; b) = \\int_{a}^b f(x) dx\\) \\(F(x)\\) typically looks like but note that it does not need to be concave. \\(E(X) = \\int_0^{\\infty} xf(x) dx = \\int_0^{\\infty} [1-F(x)]dx\\)  Discrete random variables #  A random variable \\(X\\) is said to be a discrete random variable if \\(X\\) takes values from a countable set of numbers \\(\\{x_1,x_2, ..., x_n, ...\\}\\).\n  Probability distribution of \\(X\\) where \\(p_n = \\Pr(X = x_n), n=1, 2, 3, ...\\)\n  \\(E(X) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} x_n \\, p_n\\)\n  The distribution function \\(F(x)\\) is a piece-wise constant function (also called step function).   Moments of a random variable #  Expectation and variance #  Expectation of \\(X\\): $$E(X) = \\int_0^{\\infty} xf(x) dx.$$ Variance of \\(X\\): $$Var(X) = E\\{[X-E(X)]^2\\} = E(X^2) -[E(X)]^2.$$\nFurthermore:\n \\(Var(X)\\) measures the variability of \\(X\\). The larger the variance, the more variability \\(X\\) has. If \\(Var(X) = 0\\), \\(X \\equiv c \\equiv E(X)\\). There is no variability for \\(X\\). \\(X\\) is a constant. If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, then $$Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y).$$ \\(Var(aX)= a^2 Var(X)\\)  Moments of the average of iid rv‚Äôs #  Assume \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) are independently and identically distributed, with $$E(X_1) = \\mu,\\text{ and } Var(X_1) = \\sigma ^2.$$ Define $$Y_n = \\frac{1}{n}(X_1+X_2+...+X_n)$$ to be the average of \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\). Then $$E(Y_n) = \\frac{1}{n}(E(X_1)+E(X_2)+...+E(X_n)) = \\frac{1}{n}(\\mu +\\mu+...+\\mu) =\\mu$$ and $$Var(Y_n) = \\frac{1}{n^2}(Var(X_1) + Var(X_2) + ... +Var(X_n)) = \\frac{1}{n^2}(\\sigma^2+\\sigma^2+...+\\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}.$$ When \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\), \\(Var(Y_n) \\rightarrow 0\\).

With an infinite sample of \\(X\\)‚Äôs, you can estimate \\(\\mu\\) with certainty.\nSelected distributions #  Binomial distribution #  If \\(X \\sim Bin(n, p)\\), then $$\\Pr(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k(1-p)^{n-k}, \\ \\ \\ 0\u0026lt;p\u0026lt;1, k=0, 1, 2,..., n.$$\nNote:\n \\(E(X) = np\\), \\(Var(X) = np(1-p)\\). \\(F(k) = \\Pr(X\\leq k) = \\sum_{j=0}^k \\Pr(X=j) = \\sum_{j=0}^k {\\binom{n}{j}} p^j (1-p)^{n-j}, \\ \\ \\ k =0,1,2,...,n\\). \\(F(2.5) = \\Pr(X \\leq 2.5) = \\Pr(X \\leq 2) = F(2)\\). \\(X\\) represents # of successes out of \\(n\\) independent trials, each trail has two outcomes: sucess with probability \\(p\\) OR failure with probability \\(1-p\\).

Probablility theory and statistics (MW 1.2) #  Please review:\n Random variables and distribution functions (MW 1.2.1) Terminology in statistics (MW 1.2.2)  Tutorial exercises for Module 1 are focused on revisions of assumed known materials.\nContinuous vs discrete random variables #  Random variables are either\n discrete distribution function (df) is \\(\\Pr[X\\le x] \\equiv F_X(x)\\) (cadlag) probability mass function (pmf) is \\(\\Pr[X=x]\\) continuous cumulative distribution function (cdf) is \\(F_X(x)\\) (cadlag) probability density function (pdf) is defined by $$f_X(x)\\equiv\\frac{d F_X(x)}{d x}.$$ This is NOT a probability. mixed  The Riemann-Stieltjes integral #  The Riemann-Stieltjes notation allows to write expressions for any type of rv.

It is used very widely by actuaries in industry (see, for instance, http://insightriskconsulting.co.uk/blog/r-for-actuaries/ or https://www.actuaries.digital/2019/09/26/my-top-10-r-packages-for-data-analytics/ ). Some companies also use R to produce presentations and documentation for generally.\nIn order to help you with R I have put together a website that summarises all the things I think you should know before starting your first grad role: https://communicate-data-with-r.netlify.app At the very least, you need to know what is under ‚ÄúBase R.‚Äù Learning the ‚Äútidyverse‚Äù will be most useful, as well as ‚Äúggplot2‚Äù for better visualisations. ‚Äúhtmlwidgets‚Äù is more advanced, and not required for the course. You may want to create your assignment with ‚ÄúR Markdown‚Äù (under ‚ÄúCommunicate Data‚Äù), although this is not required either.\nThe main reference for Base R is the book http://biostatisticien.eu/springeR/index-en.html, which is also available in other languages (including mandarin).
