      <description>Week 1 Overview #  This week, we will cover the following topics:
 Introduction to the course: what are the topics we will cover in this subject, and how are they connected? Risk and Insurance (Module 1.1-1.3): to put it in the way the CM2 notes puts it, how do we model the behaviours of agents on a market? What is a possible mathematical model for “rational” behaviour, that could explain why people purchase insurance?</description>

 explore some example of time series which we will further analyse later in the time series modules introduce some basic models (which we will review in full detail in Module 9) discuss the concept of “Stationarity” Finally, discuss the estimation of “correlation” in the context of time series (the presence of which, really, is the whole point of time series analysis)   -- If you wish to watch the embedded videos from Lecture Capture, you need to have logged in and entered Lecture Capture via Canvas once for each session.</description>

      <description>Introduction - Claims liabilities #  Definition #   Generally in insurance, premiums are collected first, before coverage is provided. The insurer can’t consider this premium as income before coverage is provided. Furthermore, as times goes by, the insurer does not know instantly how much losses it will have to pay (e.g., delays in notification, delays in payments).    This gives rise to two types of liabilities:  Unearned premium liability: an amount set aside for covering losses related to coverage not yet provided, but where a premium has already been collected; Outstanding claim liability: an amount set aside for for covering losses corresponding to coverage that has already been provided, but where payments are still expected to occur.</description>

      <description>Introduction #  Decision making under risk and uncertainty #  Context #   In an Enterprise Risk Management context (ERM), “risk” is defined as the “effect of uncertainty on objectives” So essential ingredients here are:  having an objective (e.g. maximise profit under some solvency constraint) having to make a decision (e.g. decide on how much to (re)insure) the object is subject to uncertainty (e.g. the amount of losses an insurer will have to pay)    Understand decisions #   In economics (and social science in general), one can be interested in understanding / modelling how and why individuals make decisions.</description>

      <description>Exposure (2.1) #  General idea #  Assume that we there exists \(e(i)\) so that we can write
$$E[N(i,j)] \equiv e(i) \mu(j),$$ where (this is important), \(\mu(j)\) does not depend on \(i\).
 \(e(i)\) will be called the exposure in period of occurrence \(i\) (for instance, “car-years”). \(\mu(j)\) may be interpreted as relative claim frequency in period \(j\) (per unit of exposure). The cumulative version $$\frac{E[N(i,\cdot)]}{e(i)} = \mu(\cdot)$$ is the relative frequency of claim occurence per period.</description>

      <description>Case estimation (3.1) #  Case estimates: Definition #   When a claim is notified, the insurer’s employee who manages the claim (the “claims adjuster”) typically formulates an estimate of the (remaining) cost of the claim and records it in the system. This estimate is typically adjusted over time as payments are made and additional information becomes available. These is called a “case estimate” (equivalently, “individual estimate”, “manual estimate”, “physical estimate”).</description>

 unadjusted chain ladder on paid losses inflation adjusted chain ladder on paid losses unadjusted chain ladder on incurred losses inflation adjusted chain ladder on incurred losses separation payments per claim incurred (PPCI)  The IBNR claims (counts) were estimated according to a number of methods, too:
 exposure normaliser chain ladder  Motivation #   All those methods are producing outstanding liability $ estimates in nominal terms.</description>
