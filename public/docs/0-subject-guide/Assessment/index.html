<!-- ## Penalties for Late Submission and Exceeding Word Limits -->
<!-- In order to ensure equality for all students, assignments and examinations (where relevant) must be submitted by specified deadlines. Late submissions will attract the following marking penalties (unless approval for late submission has been granted): -->
<!-- **All assignments (excluding examinations):** 10% penalty per day *of the total maximum mark for the piece of assessment*. -->
<!-- Assignments that exceed word limits may also attract a marking penalty in line with University policy. Students with a genuine and acceptable reason for not completing an assignment (or other assessment task), such as illness, can apply for special consideration (see Policies below). -->
<!-- **Examinations:** -->
<!-- Canvas Quiz will automatically submit the exam when the time limit (comprised of reading time & writing time) has been reached (for example, after 60 minutes for an exam with 30 minutes of writing time and 30 minutes of reading time). Students must click ‘submit’ at the completion time if they did not start the exam at the scheduled commencement time to not incur any late penalty. -->
<!-- For example, a 60-minute exam scheduled at 3:00pm, but commenced at 3:15pm, will automatically submit at 4:15pm and the student will incur a late penalty. Students must click 'submit' at 4:00pm to not incur a late penalty. Students who are prevented from submitting on time or at all due to technical difficulties will need to apply for technical consideration with supporting documentation. -->

<!-- # Format of online exams -->
<!-- The final exams will be a Canvas quiz. Questions will be randomised, such that there are millions of possible combinations of questions, even before answers are shuffled (and they will be when relevant). -->
<!-- These is an **Open Book exam**, which means that you will not be prevented from using notes or texts during the exam. However, interaction with other students is not permitted, and is a breach of the University’s Academic Integrity Policy. Any evidence of collusion will be investigated as potential academic misconduct. The Academic Integrity policy can be found at: https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/ -->
<!-- It is recommended that you use **Google Chrome** to access your exam on Canvas. Firefox has also been shown to be reliable. -->
<!-- ## Exam conditions -->
<!-- It is important for students to be in a ***private***, quiet and well-lit room. Please let us emphasize that you should not discuss exam matters with others and that you should only submit ***work of your own***. -->
<!-- The Academic Integrity policy can be found at: https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/ -->
<!-- ## Types of quiz questions -->
<!-- There will be three types of questions: -->
<!-- 1.	**Multiple Choice Question (MCQ)** with exactly one correct answer. These are similar to those used in the mid-semester exam. -->
<!-- Students get full mark for a correct answer, and 0 marks for an incorrect answer. -->
<!--   - Example: What is the result of 2 times 4? -->
<!--     1. 4 -->
<!--     1. 6 -->
<!--     1. 8 -->
<!--     1. 10 -->
<!--   - In this example there is only one correct answer – 3. -->
<!-- 2.	**Multiple Answers Questions (MAQ)** In this case, there are multiple choices, but the number of correct answers can be different from 1 (it can be anything from 0 to the number of possible choices). -->
<!-- Here is the explanation of Canvas about how marks are awarded: “To calculate scores for Multiple Answers quiz questions, Canvas divides the total points possible by the amount of correct answers for that question. This amount is awarded for every correct answer selected and deducted for every incorrect answer selected. No points are awarded or deducted for correct or incorrect answers that are not selected. For example, an instructor may create a Multiple Answer quiz question with 9 points possible that includes three correct choices and two incorrect choices. If a student selects two correct answers and one incorrect answer, they would be awarded 3 total points for that question. This would be calculated by awarding 3 points (9 total points divided by 3 correct answers) for each correct answer and subtracting 3 points for the incorrect answer.” Furthermore, there is a minimum score of 0 (you can’t get a negative score). -->
<!--   - Example: Which of the following are negative? -->
<!--     1. 4 -->
<!--     1. -6 -->
<!--     1. -8 -->
<!--     1. 10 -->
<!--   - In this example there are two correct answers: 2. and 3.. If there are 4 marks allocated to this question, marks would be awarded as follows: -->
<!--     - 2. and 3.: 2+2=4 marks -->
<!-- 	- 2. only: 2 marks -->
<!-- 	- 2. and 4.: 2-2=0 marks -->
<!-- 	- 1. and 2. and 4.: -2+2-2=-2 but there is a minimum score of 0, so 0 marks. -->
<!--   - With this type of question you must carefully assess every single answer independently of the others. -->
<!-- 3.	**Essay Questions** In this case, you must answer with text, and you get a text field to compose your answer. Note that formulas can be composed too. You may also upload a handwritten answer if you wish, although we recommend not to do this unless formulas are required extensively. -->
<!-- These questions will be marked by someone as they cannot be automatically graded. -->
<h2 id="precision-of-numerical-answers">
  Precision of numerical answers
  <a class="anchor" href="#precision-of-numerical-answers">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Students often ask about the required significant figures / decimal places.</p>
<p>If it is not specified:</p>
<ul>
<li>In an open question we will look at the reasoning so you should not be too worried about it (within reason). Use, say, 5 significant figures/digits <code>\(*\)</code></li>
<li>Otherwise the precision needs to match that of the possible answers (if we have 5 significant figures ( <code>\(*\)</code> ) in the answers then work with 6, say).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <code>\(*\)</code> Please move away from talking about decimal places - this does not take the scale of your problem into account. The correct way to think about this is in terms of <strong>significant figures/digits</strong>. For more details, see e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures"><code>Wikipedia</code></a> or <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic-home/arith-review-decimals/arithmetic-significant-figures-tutorial/v/significant-figures"><code>this video from Khan academy</code></a>.

<p>Assessments in this course will generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>test whether you can apply the methods in a realistic environment (in particular, with data and spreadsheets);</li>
<li>test whether you understand the theory behind those methods, and can explain the associated strengths and limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>To prepare for this exam we suggest you review the tutorial exercises and 
  <a href="/docs/0-subject-guide/Assessment/#past-cm2-exams"><code>past CM2 exam questions</code></a>. You should also make sure you read all prescribed readings and have <em>understood</em> the main arguments.</p>
<!-- Remember that this is an open book exam, so there is nothing to memorise. You must demonstrate understanding instead, and being able to "connect the dots". If you have done the work and know where the things are, you should be able to easily find the details you need to answer the questions. -->
<p>More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalise <em><strong>your own</strong></em> summaries and formula sheets in preparation for the exam.</li>
<li>I recommend you review carefully the 
  <a href="../../learning-outcomes/"><code>Detailed Learning Outcomes pages</code></a>:</li>
<li>Of course, review also all tutorial exercises. For each question:
<ul>
<li>What skill(s) is this exercise testing?</li>
<li>Where are the required concepts in your summaries? in your formula sheets?</li>
<li>What did you find challenging in this exercise, and how comfortable are you with this now?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ## Specific preparation for R questions -->
<!-- Here is general advice about how to prepare for that component of the subject: -->
<!-- - After the lectures (or before), make sure you implement all codes on your own machine. These can be copy pasted from the website easily, and there is nothing that is missing. I am using those exact codes to produce the outputs; there is no hidden chunk. -->
<!-- - Try to understand what each line is doing. Execute the code line by line, change parameters, see what it changes. Understand why it works or not. -->
<!-- - For each function you don't know read the help in R. For function `foo`, simply write `?foo` in the console. -->
<!-- - Google up issues, ask on Ed if you are stuck. -->
<!-- You can't wait until the exam to work out the codes. In the mid-semester exam, one could essentially copy paste the codes from the slides. In the final exam you may have to adjust slightly one way or the other, and for this you need to be on top of the lecture slide code. -->
<!-- Being able to implement those methods is really important, and what makes the assessment "authentic". This is how you would actually use that knowledge in practice, not via proving theorems (although that can be fun, too, but it is not too well suited for an open book exam). -->

<h2 id="tips">
  Tips
  <a class="anchor" href="#tips">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Remember there are different ways of answering a multiple choice/answer question (especially if it involves numbers):</p>
<ul>
<li>Work out the answer as if you were in a standard pen and paper invigilated exam, then see if the answer is in the list.</li>
<li>Work out the answer with tools that would not otherwise be available, such as Excel spreadsheet, R, or even the internet. (but be careful not to collude or otherwise be guilty of academic misconduct – check <a href="https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/">https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/</a> for further details)</li>
<li>In some circumstances, it may be easier to simply “plug back” the different answers to see which one works.
Don’t forget these three options exist for multiple choice/answer open book exams! Hence make sure you have Excel and R available and working before the exam starts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, some more advice / exam technique / tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read attentively the exam questions at least twice before attempting the question. Work out what skills you are meant to demonstrate. Make sure you understand what is being asked in the question – consider key words indicating what you have to do. When you have finished, re-read the question to make sure you have not missed anything.</li>
<li>Key is to demonstrate understanding.</li>
<li>Attempt all questions where possible.</li>
<li>If you run out of time, explain how to you would approach the task (where possible). If this is right this should give you marks.</li>
<li>Do questions you are most confident with first. Prioritise.</li>
<li>Observe the number of marks allocated. Manage time accordingly. Reassess your available time regularly (say, half way through for a 1 hour exam, and perhaps 2 times for a 2 hour exam). For instance, if the exam is one hour and there are 100 marks, then you have 36 seconds per mark.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pay close attention to the wording of the question - this is not chosen randomly. Pay particular attention to the verb (for instance: &ldquo;State&rdquo; and &ldquo;Show&rdquo; do not mean the same thing. With &ldquo;State&rdquo; you just need to give the answer, with &ldquo;Show&rdquo; you need to actually prove the answer) and adverb if any (for instance: &ldquo;briefly&rdquo; is not the same as &ldquo;in detail&rdquo;). Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘&hellip;Justify your answer’</li>
<li>‘Find’</li>
<li>‘Explain in words’</li>
<li>‘Derive’</li>
<li>‘Show that’</li>
<li>‘Briefly list’</li>
<li>‘Present in detail&hellip;’</li>
<li>‘Briefly explain’</li>
<li>‘Briefly describe’</li>
<li>‘State (without justification) 4 examples of &hellip;’</li>
</ul>
