      <description>Introduction: Models for aggregate losses #  A portfolio of contracts or a contract will potentially experience a sequence of losses: $$Y_1, Y_2, Y_3, \ldots$$ We are interested in the aggregate sum \(S\) of these losses over a certain period of time.
 How many losses will occur?  if deterministic \((n)\) \(\longrightarrow\) individual risk model if random \((N)\) \(\longrightarrow\) collective risk model   How do they relate to each other?</description>
