      <description>Week 1 Overview #  This week, we will cover the following topics:
 Introduction to the course: what are the topics we will cover in this subject, and how are they connected? Risk and Insurance (Module 1): to put it in the way the CM2 notes puts it, how do we model the behaviours of agents on a market? What is a possible mathematical model for “rational” behaviour, that could explain why people purchase insurance?</description>

In particular, we will:
 explore some example of time series which we will further analyse later in the time series modules introduce some basic models (which we will review in full detail in Module 9) discuss the concept of “Stationarity” Finally, discuss the estimation of “correlation” in the context of time series (the presence of which, really, is the whole point of time series analysis)   -- If you wish to watch the embedded videos from Lecture Capture, you need to have logged in and entered Lecture Capture via Canvas once for each session.</description>
