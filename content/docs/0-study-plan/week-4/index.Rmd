<p style="font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;">Week 4</p> 

# Overview


This week, we will cover the following topics:

- Module 4, which is concerned with the calculation of IBNR claim amounts.
- There are some slides with the main elements, but a major component of the module is with two spreadsheets, which can be downloaded [here](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/191080/modules/items/5080918) and [here](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/191080/modules/items/5080919)



See also detailed learning outcomes of 5.2 ("Liability valuations / Run-off triangles") of the CM2 syllabus [``here``](../../0-subject-guide/SILO).

# Tutorials

Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [``Ed``](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/191080/external_tools/5837?display=borderless).

## Tutorial materials

Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review The [``Tutorial book``]() includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).

## This week

All of Module 4 is in scope for the week 4 tutorials.
