# Overview 


This week, we will cover the following topics:

- Module 3, which is concerned with the calculation of IBNR claim counts.
- There are some slides with the main elements, but a major component of the module is with a spreadsheet, which can be downloaded [here](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/191080/modules/items/5059291)

# Tutorials

Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [``Ed``](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/191080/external_tools/5837?display=borderless).

<!-- ## Pre-Tutorial work -->

<!-- Please study those questions **before** the tutorial. -->

<!-- Pre-Tutorial exercises are available in the [``Pre-Tutorial book``](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391), which already includes solutions. It is recommended to attempt the questions *before* looking at the solutions -->

## Tutorial materials

Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review The [``Tutorial book``]() includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).
