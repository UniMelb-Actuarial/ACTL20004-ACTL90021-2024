# Tutorials

Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [`Ed`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/191080/external_tools/5837?display=borderless).

## Tutorial materials

Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review The [`Tutorial book`]() includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).

## This week

This week, tutorials act as consultation times, in Q&A format. Please come with lots of questions for your tutors to address.

Week 5 materials will be covered in the week 6 tutorials (after the mid-semester exam).
