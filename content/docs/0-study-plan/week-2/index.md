# Overview

This week, we will cover the following topics:

- End of Module 1 (characterising risk aversion, and additional considerations)
- Module 2, which introduces the basics of loss reserving: what it is, why it matters, notation, data

# Tutorials

Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [`Ed`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/191080/external_tools/5837?display=borderless).

<!-- ## Pre-Tutorial work -->
<!-- Please study those questions **before** the tutorial. -->
<!-- Pre-Tutorial exercises are available in the [``Pre-Tutorial book``](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391), which already includes solutions. It is recommended to attempt the questions *before* looking at the solutions -->

## Tutorial materials

<!-- Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review and attempt those questions ***prior to their scheduled tutorial***, after they complete the pre-tutorial work.  -->

The [`Tutorial book`]() includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).

## This week

Tutorial exercises in scope this week are the two last exercises (`utilins3` and `util8`) of Module 1, as well as Module 2.
