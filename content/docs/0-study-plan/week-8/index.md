Week 8
</p>

# Overview

<!-- This week, we will cover the following topics: -->

We will introduce the Time Series component of the subject, which corresponds to the Section 2 of the CS2 syllabus

In particular, we will:

- explore some example of time series which we will further analyse later in the time series modules
- introduce some basic models (which we will review in full detail in Module 9)
- discuss the concept of ‚ÄúStationarity‚Äù
- Finally, discuss the estimation of ‚Äúcorrelation‚Äù in the context of time series (the presence of which, really, is the whole point of time series analysis)

Watch: refer to your lecture recording under ‚ÄúLecture Capture‚Äù ([`UG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150824/external_tools/701)/[`PG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150864/external_tools/701)). This is where annotated slides will be made available, too.

# Additional preparation and resources

## Mandatory

1.  Chapter 1.0‚Äì1.5 of Shumway and Stoffer (2017)
2.  S6 (CS2 Time Series notes)

## Optional

1.  n/a

# Tutorials

Note that a full list of exercises is available [`here`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4466801). Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [`Ed`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/external_tools/5601?display=borderless).

## Pre-Tutorial work

Please study those questions **before** the tutorial.

Pre-Tutorial exercises are available in the [`Pre-Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391), which already includes solutions. It is recommended to attempt the questions *before* looking at the solutions

## Tutorial materials

Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review and attempt those questions ***prior to their scheduled tutorial***, after they complete the pre-tutorial work.

The [`Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464392) includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).

## This week

All of Module 7 is in scope for the tutorials this week.

## Next week (week 9)

Next week, we will discuss Module 9.1-9.3 onwards.

## Additional questions

The ‚Äúadditional questions‚Äù are here for reinforcement or revision, but are not the main focus of the tutorials. Solutions for those exercises are already available.

# Preparation for assessment

## Mid-semester (15%) and final (60%) exams

<!-- install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("hadley/emo") -->

Mid-semester exam is done! üòÑ

For the final exam:

- Finalise your Summary of Module 6;
- Start a Summary for Module 7

***Make sure you start preparing for the final exam, including getting comfortable with the R modelling side of things.***

## Assignment (25%)

- By now you should have started the analysis, and worked out how you will record your presentation.
- The presentation is ***due in two weeks***! (Thursday 11 May 11.05am sharp)
