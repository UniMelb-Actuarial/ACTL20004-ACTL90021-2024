# Tutorials

Note that a full list of exercises is available [`here`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4466801). Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [`Ed`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/external_tools/5601?display=borderless).

## Pre-Tutorial work

Please study those questions **before** the tutorial.

Pre-Tutorial exercises are available in the [`Pre-Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391), which already includes solutions. It is recommended to attempt the questions *before* looking at the solutions

## Tutorial materials

Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review and attempt those questions ***prior to their scheduled tutorial***, after they complete the pre-tutorial work.

The [`Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464392) includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).

## This week

All of Module 6 is in scope for the tutorials this week.

## Next week (week 8)

Next week, we will discuss Module 7.

## Additional questions

The “additional questions” are here for reinforcement or revision, but are not the main focus of the tutorials. Solutions for those exercises are already available.

# Preparation for assessment
