**<p style="font-size:18px;">Weekly plans</p>**

This section will provide weekly guidance about the subject activities, and links to relevant sections of the website, and documents (such as slides, for instance).


To seek help:

- ask your question in [Ed](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/220261/external_tools/5837?display=borderless), or
- ask your tutor at your next [tutorial](../0-subject-guide/Activities/#tutorials), or
- ask the course Professor at the next [consultation hours](../0-subject-guide), or
- ask your friends in the course (on [Ed](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/220261/external_tools/5837?display=borderless) or elsewhere!),

BUT do not e-mail tutors or the course Professor, unless your query is truly personal in nature, or has absolutely no chance of being of any relevance to any other student. Chances are other students have the same question, and so having the question being asked and answered publicly helps everyone.
