Week 6
</p>

# Overview

<!-- This week, we will cover the following topics: -->

This week, we have the [`mid-semester exam`](https://topics-actl.netlify.app/docs/0-subject-guide/assessment/#mid-semester-exam) on Wednesday, and the remainder of tutorials for Modules 4/5/6 on Friday. This is the last week I‚Äôll be teaching this semester!

In the lecture and tutorials, we will cover the following topics:

- End of Module 4, which is concerned with the calculation of IBNR claim ***amounts*** (the actual payments/costs).
- This week we focus on the Payment Per Claim Incurred (PPCI) method, which is akin to the Exposure methods for counts.
- There are some slides with the main elements, but major components of the module is with two spreadsheets, which can be downloaded [`here for Chapter 3`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/220261/modules/items/6021476) and [`here for the PPCI method`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/220261/modules/items/6021477)
- Module 5 discusses how to make a choice / combine diverging results from different reserving methods, and also introduced the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, which typically deals with highly leveraged triangles for their most immature years.
- In Excel, we discuss simulation, how to implement that in Excel, and also Macros. You will discuss simulation more with Yuyu.

See also detailed learning outcomes of 5.2 (‚ÄúLiability valuations / Run-off triangles‚Äù) of the CM2 syllabus, as well as CM2-B Excel examinations [`here`](../../0-subject-guide/SILO).
