Week 1
</p>

# Overview

This week, we will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to the course: what are the topics we will cover in this subject, and how are they connected?
- Risk and Insurance (Module 1.1-1.3): to put it in the way the CM2 notes puts it, how do we model the behaviours of agents on a market? What is a possible mathematical model for ‚Äúrational‚Äù behaviour, that could explain why people purchase insurance?
- We will also introduce the Excel component of the subject (Module 6.1)

See also detailed learning outcomes of 1.2 (utility theory) of the CM2 syllabus [`here`](../../0-subject-guide/SILO).

<!-- # Videos -->
<!-- Here is the week 1 video introduction. In this video I briefly introduce myself, the subject, and highlight some key aspect of the 2023 delivery and differences with previous years. -->

# Main references and lectures

<p style="font-size:12px;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
Note: Typos and issues are being updated continuously throughout the semester. The online notes are always up-to-date, and can easily be read on a mobile device (version date is at the bottom). If you download a pdf version of the slides, a version date is also available on the first page. If you click on the link ‚Äúlatest slides‚Äù you will download the latest version. You can then compare the date and work out if it was updated.

# Tutorials

Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [`Ed`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/220261/external_tools/5837?display=borderless).

<!-- ## Pre-Tutorial work -->
<!-- Please study those questions **before** the tutorial. -->
<!-- Pre-Tutorial exercises are available in the [``Pre-Tutorial book``](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391), which already includes solutions. It is recommended to attempt the questions *before* looking at the solutions -->

## Tutorial materials

<!-- Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review and attempt those questions ***prior to their scheduled tutorial***, after they complete the pre-tutorial work.  -->
<!-- The [``Tutorial book``]() includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set. -->
<!-- Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected). -->

## This week

To be announced after the lectures.

<!-- Tutorial exercises in scope this week are Sections 1.1 to 1.3, minus utilins3 (exercise 1.3.5). The two last exercises (`utilins3` and `util8`) will be covered next week. -->
<!-- Here is the recording available for Week 1 from William: -->

## Next week (week 2)

To be announced after the lectures.

<!-- The two last exercises of Module ` (`utilins3` and `util8`) will be covered next week. Also, we will start on Loss Reserving and will discuss Modules 2 (and possibly 3). -->
<!-- ## Additional questions -->
<!-- The "additional questions" are here for reinforcement or revision, but are not the main focus of the tutorials. Solutions for those exercises are already available. -->
