Continuing on with the Time Series component of the subject, which corresponds to the Section 2 of the CS2 syllabus; In particular, we will

- study in detail `\(ARMA(p,q)\)` models;
- study in detail `\(ARIMA(p,d,q)\)` models;
- introduce seasonal `\(ARIMA\)` models;
- introduce multivariate autoregressive `\(VAR(p)\)` models;
- introduce some additional models mentioned in the CS2 syllabus.

Here is the end of week 10 video, which introduces week 11:

# Tutorials

Note that a full list of exercises is available [`here`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4466801). Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [`Ed`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/external_tools/5601?display=borderless).

## Pre-Tutorial work

Please study those questions **before** the tutorial.

Pre-Tutorial exercises are available in the [`Pre-Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391), which already includes solutions. It is recommended to attempt the questions *before* looking at the solutions

## Tutorial materials

Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review and attempt those questions ***prior to their scheduled tutorial***, after they complete the pre-tutorial work.

The [`Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464392) includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).

## This week

The rest of Module 9 (Sections 4 onwards) are in scope for the tutorials this week.
